## :poop: Windows scripts

All the Windows scripts shall be provided in the [windows](https://github.com/w1bb/quick-scripts/blob/master/windows) directory.

These made it into my collection:

- :globe_with_meridians: Internet Blocker ([internet-blocker.bat](https://github.com/w1bb/quick-scripts/blob/master/windows/internet-blocker.bat))

  This script will quickly block internet access to all the executable files (`(*.exe)`) inside a given folder (`[INSERT PATH HERE]`), recursively (`/R`). Both inbound (`dir=in`) and outbound (`dir=out`) connections will cease to exist.
